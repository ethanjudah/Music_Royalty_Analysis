Analysis of Royalty (music) data

Using the Excel workbook provided, analyse the data and create visualisations that will enable you to demonstrate the state of neighbouring rights royalties to your line manager before they meet with the board and discuss any key data stories. The board’s key concerns would include:

•	How overall royalties have grown over time

•	Where our royalties are come from

•	Who are our top earnings clients and tiers

•	Which works are our top earnings works

The board would also be interested in understanding how much we are losing to suspicious accounts and deactivated works. Share any other insights you think would be relevant for them to see. There may be some data cleansing required of the datasets.
